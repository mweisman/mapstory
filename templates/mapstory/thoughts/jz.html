	<h2>Beyond Pushpin Mapping: The Power of Crisis MapStorytelling</h2>

	<p><img src="/static/img/jz.jpg" class="thoughts" alt="" /></p>

	<p>In recent years, the crisis mapping community has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.  Now, every crisis is enjoined by a global community of crisis mappers within minutes, equipped to generate geospatial data that is critical to crisis response and recovery.  In real-time, this community brings geospatial situational awareness to governments and NGOs from around the world, so that they can more effectively target their resources in support of peoples at risk.</p>

	<p>Platforms such as Ushahidi have empowered us to engage in spatially and temporally enabled incident reporting and management, including the empowerment of effected populations to report their observations via GeoSMS.  OpenStreetMap has enabled our community to leverage increasingly ubiquitous commercial imagery to generate the best current representation of streets and other basic features.</p>

	<p>Yet, we have a long way to go.</p>

	<p>Ushahidi is deployed in the face of a crisis, to track and manage incidents that occur.  OpenStreetMap is used to rapidly fill basemap data gaps when crises befall poorly mapped places.  Yet, neither of these platforms are dedicated to mapping complex phenomena as they evolve over time.  While we have made great strides, now we often find ourselves stuck with a basemap with pushpins, which simply cannot capture and convey the complexity of the socio-cultural and natural dynamics at play in crisis environments.  And, too often, we find ourselves bound by the “data”, with little ability to project our narratives – our stories, which are syntheses of the data that communicate our experience and understanding of a complex situation.</p>

	<p>MapStory offers the crisis mapping community a new tool for their kit bag, which holds the promise of providing such capabilities.  MapStory self-consciously empowers users to both describe phenomenologically complex dimensions of our changing work, while also empowering observers to publish their narratives (as MapStories) to a global audience.  Moreover, MapStory, as a global data commons, provides a place where experts of all kinds can organize their knowledge about the world spatially and temporally – regardless of the crisis de jour.  The hope I have for MapStory is that large volumes of useful prior knowledge about historically neglected geographies will accumulate in MapStory that will be at the fingertips of the crisis mapping community when bad things happen.</p>

	<p>Too often, crisis mappers are forced to race against the clock to assemble datasets about effected geographies &#8211; data that are scattered, difficult to discover, hard to move, and which require significant transformation before they can be used to create a common operating picture.  This has been a chronic shortfall, partially because this helter skelter organization has meant that we have no way to understand our data gaps so that we can proactively close these data gaps over geographies prone to disaster and humanitarian crisis.  The opportunity that MapStory offers the crisis mapping community, in this regard, is huge.</p>

	<p>But, the empowerment of storytelling offered by MapStory is what most excites me.  From my own research into the Angolan civil war, I know all too well the data challenges that we face.  I coded and georeferenced some 10,000 conflict events spanning all 41 years of this violent war using hundreds of sources and a detailed exhumation of Portuguese newspaper archives.  It is one of the largest and most detailed micro-level conflict datasets available in the field of crisis mapping.  Yet, how can I convey the complexity of this conflict and plethora of nested humanitarian crises in a narrative that others can learn from?  How can I develop unique crisis maps that reveal underlying conflict processes, and how they unfold over time?  How do I convey these stories to both decision-makers and publics?</p>

	<p>The opportunity offered by MapStory to the crisis mapping community is nascent, yet hard to ignore.  Those of us in governments and international NGOs can publish our data into MapStory as a global data commons that depicts change over time, providing the larger crisis mapping community with crucial insights about the situation leading up to a crisis.  Those of us in the academe can share our research with a global community of practitioners and policymakers in a form that is easy for them to discover and to incorporate into their own stories.  Most interesting, MapStory empowers those affected by crises (at least once they have some sort of connectivity) to share their own stories, building off of those in the crisis mapping community.</p>

	<p>While crisis mapping has come a long way in such a short time, there are new frontiers to be conquered.  Moving beyond pushpins and basemaps to more complex storytelling will be key.</p>
